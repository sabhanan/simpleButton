    <p>Disneyland Tokyo adalah taman rekreasi Disneyland dengan luas mencapai 465,000 m² dan merupakan taman rekreasi dan resort Disney pertama yang dibangun di luar Amerika. Dibangun oleh Walt Disney Imagineering, taman rekreasi ini dibuat mirip dengan Disneyland yang terletak di Anaheim, California.
        Tokyo Disneyland (東京ディズニーランド, Tōkyō Dizunīrando) (local nickname TDL)[1] is a 115-acre (47 ha) theme park at the Tokyo Disney Resort in Urayasu, Chiba Prefecture, Japan, near Tokyo.[2] Its main gate is directly adjacent to both Maihama Station and Tokyo Disneyland Station. It was the first Disney park to be built outside the United States and it opened on April 15, 1983. The park was constructed by WED Enterprises in the same style as Magic Kingdom in Florida and Disneyland in California.[2] It is owned by The Oriental Land Company, which licenses intellectual property from The Walt Disney Company. Tokyo Disneyland and its companion park, Tokyo DisneySea, are the only Disney parks in the world not owned or operated by The Walt Disney Company in any capacity.

The park has seven themed areas: the World Bazaar; the four traditional Disney lands: Adventureland, Westernland, Fantasyland and Tomorrowland; and two mini-lands: Critter Country and Toontown. Many of these areas mirror those in the original Disneyland as they are based on American Disney films and fantasies. Fantasyland includes Peter Pan's Flight, Snow White's Scary Adventures, and Dumbo the Flying Elephant, based on Disney films and characters.[3] The park is noted for its extensive open spaces to accommodate the large crowds that visit the park.[2] In 2022 Tokyo Disneyland hosted 12 million visitors, making it the fourth-most visited theme park in the world and the second-most visited theme park in Asia.[4]
